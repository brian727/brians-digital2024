# Polishing Up Hartman Glass Mirror & Metal

## Making a long standing Tucson glass supplier sparkle online

### Challenge

Hartman Glass Mirror & Metal is a long standing small business in Tucson with a deep list of loyal clients. They hired me to develope their social media presence and evaluate their digital ad strategy. The owner wanted to optimize thier organic search results and minimize their Google Ad spend. The owner also wanted to update their website and create fresh photographic elements.
