## Giffords shooting suspect had trouble at PCC

Pima Community College says the accused gunman in a shooting that killed six people and wounded Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords was a former PCC student who voluntarily withdrew last October after he was suspended for code of conduct violations.

PCC says 22-year-old Jared Loughner had five contacts with campus police for classroom and library disruptions at the northwest and west campuses.  On September 29, PCC says, campus police discovered a YouTube video filmed on the northwest campus where he claims the college is illegal according to the U.S. Constitution, and he makes other claims.

PCC says Loughner and his parents met administrators on October 4, 2010, and Loughner indicated he would withdraw from the College.  Campus officials said he would have to have to resolve his Code of Conduct violations and obtain a mental health clearance indicating, in the opinion of a mental health professional, his presence at the college did not present a danger to himself or others.

Loughner left an Internet posting on his MySpace page before the shooting:  "Goodbye friends, don't be mad at me."

The latest video, posted dated Dec. 15, includes comments on "English literacy, dreaming and a new moral 'currency'."

"In conclusion, it is my ambition  - is for informing literate dreamers about a new currency. In a few days, you'll know I am conscience dreaming. Thank you!" says the final slide of a video called "Hello."

Search warrants were served in the Tucson area, including the home of Loughner's parents in the 7700 bock of North Soledad Avenue, Pima County Sheriff's department spokesman Rick Kastigar said.

Deputies recovered a pistol with an extended handle, Kastigar added.

Further information on what was seized by deputies was not immediately available.

Loughner's YouTube channel has three videos detailing his opinion on government failures.

Here's a look at Loughner's MySpace page, which has been restricted from public view.
