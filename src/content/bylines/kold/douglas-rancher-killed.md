## Arizona reactions over Douglas rancher's murder

When Robert Krentz radioed his brother late Saturday morning on the two-way, all he heard was "illegal alien" and "hurt".

The two men were working in separate ATVs on the 35,000 acre ranch in northeast Douglas to mend fencing and repair water lines.

He suspected something was up, but wasn't worried-- Krentz was known to help those in need. Immigrants passing through the ranch was nothing out of the ordinary, either.

It wasn't until Krentz failed to meet his brother at noon when he knew something was wrong. He began to search the ranch for his brother with the help of his family.

By 6:20 p.m. that night, Krentz's family decided to call the authorities and file a missing persons report.

Search and rescue teams with Cochise County Sheriffs finally found Krentz dead inside his ATV, near his wounded dog just before midnight.

Krentz was shot.

While the investigation is still on going, detectives say Krentz drove 1,000 feet in his ATV after being shot.

Sheriffs say the shooter approached Krentz and shot him while he was on the ATV-- a Polaris style model with a roll cage. Footprints lead trackers to the Mexico border almost 20 miles south.

Cochise County Sheriffs, Border Patrol agents and officers with the Department of Corrections searched for the suspect from air and land to no avail.

No arrests have been made so far.

KOLD News talked with Krentz in May 2005 about illegal immigrants crossing through his ranch. We've attached that video to this story on the right side.

### Arizona's Politicians React

Both Gov. Brewer and Senator McCain came out against the shooting, calling on the federal government to increase security at the border.

"My thoughts and prayers are with the Krentz family during this horrible and unnecessary tragedy," said Governor Brewer.  "For over a year I have demanded that the federal government fulfill my request, joined by the Governors of Texas, New Mexico, and California, to uphold its constitutional responsibilities and increase security along the border through the deployment of additional National Guard troops.  Our citizens must be protected from border violence.  

Additional soldiers can provide critical support to law enforcement agency operations, and a surge in troops at the Arizona border has been proven in the past to be effective."

Sen. McCain write a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano.

"The federal government must do all it can within its power to curb this violence and protect its citizens from criminals coming across the border from Mexico," he said in the letter.

McCain wants to see an increased National Guard presence on the border.

Representative Gabrielle Giffords also weighed in on the murder of the Douglas rancher.

The congresswoman wants to more Border Patrol resources stationed in the remote areas of Southern Arizona and New Mexico.

"We'd also like two forward operating bases, one in New Mexico, one in Cochise County to really get ahold of this problem and assist our ranchers out there on the border," Giffords said, referring to Border Patrol stations.
