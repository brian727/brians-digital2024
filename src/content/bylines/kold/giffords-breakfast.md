## Rep. Giffords' husband shares thoughts during National Prayer Breakfast

Rep. Giffords' husband Cpt. Mark Kelly spoke Thursday morning about his wife's condition during the National Prayer Breakfast. He insisted that Giffords remain in the people's thoughts and prayers."It is really helping," he said. Kelly's candid remarks to the audience reflected on the past month, the hardest time in his life, he said. "Miraculously, Gabby survives."He shared his thoughts on the cost of the shootings-- not only to the victims' families, but the community as a whole. The incident left many asking why and how, he said. "Why were 6 people killed?" he asked. "Why was a 9-year-ol innocent child killed?"

### THE ROLE OF FATE

Kelly said during the breakfast he wasn't too into the notion of fate. " I hadn't been a big believer in fate until recently," he said.Jan. 8 seems to have shifted those views. "I thought the world just spins and the clock just ticks and things happen for no particular reason," he said. He shared some words from the Civil War era leader, President Lincoln. "The almighty has his own purposes. He believed there was a larger plan."" I was telling Gabby maybe it's possible this is one small part of that same plan," Kelly said. "Maybe something good can come from all this," he said. "Maybe it's our responsibility, your responsibility that something does."

### THE WIDER VIEW FROM SPACE

Mark Kelly and his twin brother, Scott are both astronauts. Kelly said seeing the world from orbit brings a unique point-of-view. "In space, you have an entirely different perspective of life on our planet," he said. "It's humbling to see Earth as God created it in the context of the universe." Scott was on the International Space Station on Jan. 8. He was asked by reporters what he thought of the tragedy."Our country faces a lot of challenges and the way we address those challenges is through teamwork," Scott Kelly said. "I'd like to see more teamwork from people. Not only in government, but everyone, in meeting the challenges our country faces." "Hopefully, if anything good can come from this, it's that we learn how to work together better," Scott said."We are better than this. We must do better."

### THE SACRED VIGIL

Kelly then went on to describe the spontaneous memorial that materialized on University Medical Center's lawn.People left a lot of angels and prayers there, he said. The people have turned UMC into a place of prayer, a pilgrimage site. "It's like stepping into a church, a place with heaven itself as a ceiling.""It goes to show you don't need a temple, church or mosque to pray. You don't even need a building or walls or even an altar," Kelly said. "You pray where you are. You pray when God is in your heart."

### RABBI STEPHANIE AARON'S PRAYER

The night of Jan. 8 when Rep. Giffords' life hung in the balance, her rabbi recited a prayer at her bedside.Kelly shared those words:
"In the name of God, our God of Israel. May Michael, God's angel messenger of compassion watch over your right side. May Gabriel, God's angel messenger of strength and courage be on your left. And before you, guiding your path, Uriel, God's angel of light. And behind you, supporting you stands Raphael, God's angel of healing. And over your head surrounding you is the presence of the divine."
