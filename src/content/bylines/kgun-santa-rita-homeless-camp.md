The City of Tucson is giving a homeless camp near Santa Rita Park notice to vacate.

The empty, privately-held lot known as Camp Bravo has become a refuge for the less fortunate for three years now.

Since the city gave the OK to use the land for a homeless camp, it has grown into a compound with tents and volunteers helping with food and other services.

The action to clear out the living space was taken Thursday, Andrew Squire, a spokesman for the city said. The some 42 men and women living there have until the end of the weekend to move out.

The news was posted to the Camp Bravo Facebook page with much anguish.
