# 'Little Tucson' Prints Inspired By Golden Books

TUCSON, AZ â€” Artist Rudy Flores is out with his latest creation, a series of prints inspired by the covers of those classic Little Golden Books we read as children.

The "Little Tucson Book" renders daily life in Tucson with a look and feel of the well-known series. Natives will instantly recognize some of the themes, including a nana with a chancla, a walk up Tumamoc and a very Tucsonense snack, the tortilla and butter.

These are just book covers, Flores says. No stories come with these prints.

Flores says he wanted to shift his focus from 3D printing to illustrations after adding another child to the family. He and his wife, Teresa Estrella, created the Army Man project that was a hit three years ago. The faces of some 300 Tucsonans were transposed onto plastic Army figures using the 3D printing method.
