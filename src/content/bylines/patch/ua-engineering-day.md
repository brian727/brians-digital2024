# WiFi-Beacon Concept Wins Top Prize In UA Engineering's Design Day

TUCSON â€” In emergencies, the solar-powered beacons would be launched from a drone so rescuers can be connected in remote areas.

The concept, created by a team of six University of Arizona engineers, won Best Overall Design in this year's Design Day competition. UA Engineering Design Day is an annual event that showcases the year-long capstone design work of engineering seniors.

The Grasshopper Harvester took home the 1st prize. The team created a method to collect the pests from agricultural fields without pesticides. Other winning prototypes included a sensor that could measure how old bruises are and a smart watering system that detects how thirsty plants are.
