# Hung Jury In No More Deaths Scott Warren Trial

TUCSON, AZ â€” Defense attorneys for No More Deaths volunteer Scott Warren say the 8 of the 12 jurors hearing his federal case believed the man was not guilty on all three of his charges. The jury returned without a verdict Tuesday after three days of deliberating whether or not he conspired to harbor undocumented immigrants.

Arizona Daily Star reporter Curt Prendergrast tweeted the latest on the case Tuesday afternoon. Federal prosecutors have not commented on whether they'll retry Warren. The judge on the case has scheduled a status conference on July 2, The Arizona Daily Star reports.

If convicted, he would've faced up to 20 years in prison.
