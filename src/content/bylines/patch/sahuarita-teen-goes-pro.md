# Sahuarita High School Ballplayer Goes Pro With Oakland A's

TUCSON, AZ â€” Sahuarita High School's Jose Diochea signed a professional baseball deal with the Oakland A's in the MLB Draft's 8th round, worth an estimated $161,000. The right-hander is widely being reported as the first Arizona high school baseball player ever to make such a jump.

Recruiters zeroed in on Dicochea's fastball, which clocks in at 96 mph. He was signed to play for the University of Arizona before being picked.

Other local highlights include the University of Arizona's Nick Quintana, Cameron Cannon, Matt Frazier, and Avery Weems.
