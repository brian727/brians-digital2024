# Scottsdale's Dolphinaris Among Most Deadly For Bottlenose Species

PHOENIX, AZ — Scottsdale's aquarium that once housed dolphins had the most marine-mammal deaths ever recorded in the U.S., an analysis of federal data shows. Dolphinaris Arizona was only open for about two years, but saw four dolphins die before being closed earlier this year.

The rates of such deaths were four times higher than any other facility housing dolphins in the U.S., according The Arizona Republic.

The aquarium was built on a block of undeveloped desert off the 101, roughly between the Salt River Reservation and the McCormick Ranch Club and opened in October 2016. The site is surrounded by acres of wild desert, reaching temperatures of 100 degrees or more — about 110 days of the year. The area's water source is either piped or funneled in from other places.
