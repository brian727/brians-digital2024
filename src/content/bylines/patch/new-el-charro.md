# El Charro's Latest Restaurant Opens Wednesday In Northwest Tucson

TUCSON, AZ â€” The El Charro family's latest restaurant concept, Charrovida, opens Wednesday at the Casa Adobes Plaza on Ina and Oracle.

Charrovida is described as a Mediterranean-Sonoran fusion restaurant featuring plant-based dishes with sustainable ingredients. The menu will be healthy but flavorful, Carlotta Flores told the Arizona Daily Star.

Flores will be running the back of the house in the kitchen. This is the third new concept the Flores family has opened in three years.
