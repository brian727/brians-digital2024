# Arizona, Social Media Pay Tribute To Grumpy Cat

PHOENIX, AZ — Grumpy Cat, the adorably sourpussed feline known to his Phoenix-area humans as Tardar Sauce and immortalized by social media, died surrounded by loved ones still frowning Tuesday. The beloved pet was 7.

Everyone's favorite cat that never failed to delight died of complications of a urinary tract infection, Grumpy's family, who live in Morristown, said in a statement Friday.

Grumpy's death came "despite care from top professionals, as well as from her very loving family," humans Tabatha, Bryan and Chrystal wrote in the statement.

"Besides being our baby and a cherished member of the family, Grumpy Cat has helped millions of people smile all around the world — even when times were tough," the family wrote. "Her spirit will continue to live on through her fans everywhere."
