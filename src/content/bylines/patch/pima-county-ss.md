# Here’s How Far Social Security Income Goes In Pima County

TUCSON, AZ — A new interactive map shows just how far Social Security goes depending on where you live. The tool, developed by the personal finance site SmartAsset, ranked Pima County the 4th best in the state when it comes to where Social Security benefits go furthest, with Mohave County ranking No. 1 in the state.

The study aimed to help retirees who rely mainly on Social Security benefits for their income. The authors looked at the typical Social Security income for each county, then subtracted for taxes to determine how much that retiree actually sees. The study also accounted for county-level cost of living expenses and then indexed the results to make the results easier to understand. A score of 100 shows where Social Security would cover the most needs, the authors said. In the other words, the higher the score, the further the benefits go.
