# Dozens Of Rescued Tortoises Available For Adoption In Tucson

TUCSON, AZ â€” It's been a tough road for Charlie and Hook, a pair of tortoises who've been nursed back to life with some help from Arizona Game and Fish.

When a driver struck the animals, Charlie's shell was badly damaged. Hook had to have his right foot amputated.

Staff with Arizona Game and Fish's Tortoise Adoption Program helped the two and dozens of others heal. Now, they're looking to be placed into a loving home.

Tegan Wolf, a coordinator with the adoption program, says the tortoise species is a resilient one, but those looking to adopt must meet certain requirements.
