# Tucson's Oat Mamas Made A Cookbook For Breastfeeding Moms

TUCSON, AZ â€” A pair of Tucson moms are taking their culinary expertise for breastfeeding moms to the next level with a new cookbook coming out this July.

Tucson-based Oat Mama, a company run by natives Kristy Kohler and Eliza Larson, have collected some 80 whole food recipes that boost nutritious milk production in Eat To Feed. The book builds on their initial granola bar concept they came up with when both were carrying for newborns.

"At the time there were only lactation cookies on the market and we recognized the need for a healthier, tastier lactation snack," Larson told the Arizona Daily Star.

She says each recipe was created to contain one or more milk supporting foods and herbs.
