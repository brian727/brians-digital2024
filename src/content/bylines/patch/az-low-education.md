# Arizona Ranks 4th From Last When It Comes To School Spending

PHOENIX, AZ — Arizona spends less on the typical student than the rest of the country, according to new figures released this week by the U.S. Census Bureau. And while it’s easy to say more spending on schools and teachers is a good thing, studies have been mixed on the effect public education spending has on learning outcomes and school completion rates.

Spending per American student for pre-K through 12th grade increased 3.7 percent to $12,201 during Fiscal Year 2017, the agency reported. That number ranged from as low as $7,179 in Utah all the way up to $23,091 in New York.

Arizona spends $8,003 per pupil, the data showed. Salaries and wages account for $4,751 per pupil and worker benefits make up $1,514 per student. Arizona joins Utah, Oklahoma and Mississippi as the four states who spend the least in the US.
