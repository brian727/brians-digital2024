The benefits of therapeutic horse riding have been touted in a study by the Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders.

The findings showed 70 percent of children with autism who rode with horses reached 70 percent of their target behaviors.

In Tucson, an organization is helping local children with this type of therapy.

Therapeutic Riding of Tucson has been giving these sessions to thousands of children and adults since 1974.

Local volunteers make it all happen.
